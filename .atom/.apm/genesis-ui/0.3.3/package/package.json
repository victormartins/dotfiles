{"name":"genesis-ui","theme":"ui","version":"0.3.3","description":"UI theme for Genesis Syntax","license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jmcalaway/atom-genesis-ui.git"},"engines":{"atom":">0.40.0"},"readme":"# Genesis Atom UI\n\nThis is a UI theme to the <a href=\"https://atom.io/themes/genesis-syntax\">Genesis Syntax Theme</a>. Its light, minimalistic design is meant to be a welcome contrast to the syntax theme.\n\nAs of 02/15/16, this UI features a <b><i>Focus Mode*</i></b> that lowers the opacity of all UI elements that are not immediately relevant--unless hovered on. The most noticeable characteristic of Focus Mode is how it effects your Tree View. In Focus Mode, your Tree View will only display open folders--unless hovered on. The purpose of this is to minimize the distraction of websites with complex directories, allowing you to only see the files that you're currently working with.\n\n* Focus Mode will, in a future update, be an optional setting for this theme. If you've been using the Genesis UI since before the conception of Focus Mode and are not happy with this mode's temporary obligation, feel free to contact me via GitHub. For now, enjoy a clutter-free workspace!\n\n* Check out the <a href=\"https://atom.io/themes/genesis-syntax\">Genesis Syntax Theme</a>\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/atom-genesis-ui/master/genesis-ui-sample.jpg)","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jmcalaway/atom-genesis-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jmcalaway/atom-genesis-ui#readme","_id":"genesis-ui@0.3.3","_shasum":"dd33fb33b7d2c4ad68d111c723891f5a5ab5cc55","_resolved":"file:../d-116231-45361-taq3lb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116231-45361-taq3lb/package.tgz"}
